## Custom Detectron which references original Detectron2 
### Changes made by Johan

Losses:
	IOU based losses : (with bounding boxes not with delta values as done in original code)
		DIOU : Done
		CIOU : in progress
		
Evaluation
	1. Results as a dataframe for easier evaluation of bbox predictions : Done
	2. Saving coco prediction results in separate files for evaluation later : in progress

Reference for IOU losses which were used to construcut D2 version of it.
